        My main expertise lies in the <span>Javascript ecosystem</span> with the <span>MERN</span>{' '}
        stack as my specialty. In addition to building rest APIs with no-sql databases I also have
        experience with relational databases such as MysQL and Postgres, as well as GrapQL. Recently
        I’ve worked a lot with <span>NextJS 13 and Turborepo</span>.

        As a frontend developer my focus is creating great and <span>performant</span> user
        experiences. I do that best with <span>React</span> as my main building block, whether using
        Vite or NextJS. I enjoy designing beautiful, responsive and feature rich interfaces. To{' '}
        <span>manage state</span> I mainly use Redux or Context API, or a combination. For styling I
        prefer <span>TailwindCSS</span> and/or SASS. When third party components are not an option,{' '}
        <span>Storybook</span> is great for building out a component library. To add{' '}
        <span>animations</span> or 3D effects, framer-motion is my preferred tool. In addition to
        React’s own testing library I use Jest and Cypress for <span>testing</span>. The most
        exciting thing to me in frontend development currently is what NextJS and React are doing
        with <span>server-side rendering</span>. It changes the way we write our frontend code and
        can potentially bring together front- and backend to an extent we are not used to.

        well as designing the <span>data layer</span> and making it accessible to the
        frontend.Security, scalability and
        <span>testing</span> testing are also of critical importance. I have vast experience
        creating <span>REST APIs</span> with no-sql databases like MongoDB but also relational
        databases such as MySQL and Postgres. In addition, I have worked with <span>GraphQL</span>{' '}
        on a few occasions. I have experience dealing with CORS, CSRF, Authentication/Authorization
        with <span>refresh/access</span> tokens and user sessions. I have some devops experience
        with <span>CI/CD</span> and deployment including YAML, NGINX and handling environment
        variables. I feel confident in writing basic <span> BASH</span> scripts
