        My main expertise lies in the <span>Javascript ecosystem</span> with the <span>MERN</span>{' '}
        stack as my specialty.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy working in <span>teams</span> and in fast-paced environments. For me, teamwork
        in software development is best carried out using agile methodologies. I like to be part of
        the entire <span>project lifecycle</span>. Seeing a project go from product specification
        over development, testing and optimization to deployment is very satisfying.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to building rest APIs with no-sql databases, I also have experience with{' '}
        <span>relational databases</span> such as MysQL and Postgres, as well as GrapQL.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m always curious about new technologies. Recently I’ve worked a lot with{' '}
        <span>NextJS 13 and Turborepo</span>. Two technologies I’m very excited about.

        Specialized in Javascript and the MERN stack. I enjoy working in a fast-paced and agile
        development team. Experienced throughout the full project life cycle, including testing,
        optimization and deployment. I have worked with both no-sql and relational databases. I’m
        always looking to expand my knowledge by exploring new technologies, recently with a focus
        on NextJS 13 and Turborepo.

        As a frontend developer my focus is creating great and <span>performant</span> user
        experiences. I do that best with <span>React</span> as my main building block, whether using
        Vite or NextJS.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy designing beautiful, responsive and feature rich interfaces. For styling I
        prefer <span>TailwindCSS</span> and/or SASS. When third party components are not an option,{' '}
        <span>Storybook</span> is great for building out a component library. To add{' '}
        <span>animations</span> or 3D effects, framer-motion is my preferred tool.
        <br />
        <br />
        For <span>state management</span> I mainly use Redux or Context API, or a combination.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to React’s own testing library I use Jest and Cypress for <span>testing</span>.
        If I don't have a backend to test against I like to use Firebase or a mock API such as
        json-server
        <br />
        <br />
        The most exciting thing to me in frontend development currently is what NextJS and React are
        doing with <span>server-side rendering</span>. It changes the way we write our frontend code
        and can potentially bring together front- and backend to an extent we are not used to.
