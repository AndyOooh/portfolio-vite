        My main expertise lies in the <span>Javascript ecosystem</span> with the <span>MERN</span>{' '}
        stack as my specialty. In addition to building rest APIs with no-sql databases I also have
        experience with relational databases such as MysQL and Postgres, as well as GrapQL. Recently
        I’ve worked a lot with <span>NextJS 13 and Turborepo</span>.

        As a frontend developer my focus is creating great and <span>performant</span> user
        experiences. I do that best with <span>React</span> as my main building block, whether using
        Vite or NextJS. I thoroughly enjoy designing beautiful, responsive and feature rich
        interfaces. For styling I prefer <span>TailwindCSS</span> and/or SASS, potentially with a
        customizable component library like DaisyUI. In large productions and when third party
        components are not an option, <span>Storybook</span> is a great tool for building out a
        component library. To add <span>animations</span> or 3D effects to the UI, framer-motion is
        my preferred tool. In addition to React’s own testing library I use Jest and Cypress for{' '}
        <span>testing</span> on the frontend. The most exciting thing to me in frontend development
        currently is what NextJS and React are doing with <span>server-side rendering</span>. It
        changes the way we write our frontend code and can potentially bring together front- and
        backend to an extent we are not used to.
