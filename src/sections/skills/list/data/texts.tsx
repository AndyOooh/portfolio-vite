          As a frontend developer my focus is creating great and <span>performant</span> user
          experiences. I do that best with <span>React</span> as my main building block, whether
          using Vite or NextJS.

        <p>
          I enjoy designing beautiful, responsive and feature rich interfaces. For styling I prefer{' '}
          <span>TailwindCSS</span> and/or SASS. When third party components are not an option,{' '}
          <span>Storybook</span> is great for building out a component library. To add{' '}
          <span>animations</span> or 3D effects, framer-motion is my preferred tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <span>state management</span> I mainly use Redux or Context API, or a combination.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to React’s own testing library I use Jest and Cypress for <span>testing</span>
          . If I don't have a backend to test against I like to use Firebase or a mock API such as
          json-server

        <p>
          The most exciting thing to me in frontend development currently is what NextJS and React
          are doing with <span>server-side rendering</span>. It changes the way we write our
          frontend code and can potentially bring together front- and backend to an extent we are
          not used to.
