          A <span>Danish</span> national relocated to buzzling <span>Bangkok</span> some years ago.
          I spend my days in the 'big mango' with my girlfriend, playing football and{' '}
          <span>building web</span> things.
          <br />
          <span>My interest</span> in web development began in <span>2020</span> when I couldn't
          find the tools I needed for my crypto projects. After playing around with different{' '}
          <span>APIs</span> in the backend, the frontend quickly caught my interest as well. <br />
          <br />
          <span>Fast-forward</span> to today, I now have +1 year of working experience as a <span>full stack developer</span> and Iâ€™ve completed dozens of courses,{' '}
          <span>bootcamps</span>, personal projects and a few collaborations.
